        Octopuses have three hearts. Two of the hearts work exclusively to move
        blood beyond the animal’s gills, while the third keeps circulation
        flowing for the organs.
      </li>
      <li>
        The plural of octopus is octopuses. The word’s Greek roots means it’s
        pluralized as a Greek word, which depends on both a noun’s gender and
        the last letter it ends with. In this case, an -es is simply tacked on.
        So no octopi, octopodes or octopussies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Octopus ink doesn’t just hide the animal. The ink also physically harms
        enemies. It contains a compound called tyrosinase, which, in humans,
        helps to control the production of the natural pigment melanin. But when
        sprayed in a predator’s eyes, tyrosinase causes a blinding irritation.
        The defensive concoction is so potent that octopuses which do not escape
        their own ink cloud can die.
      </li>
      <li>
        Octopuses have blue blood. To survive in the deep ocean, octopuses
        evolved a copper rather than iron-based blood called hemocyanin, which
        turns its blood blue. This copper base is more efficient at transporting
        oxygen than hemoglobin when water temperature is very low and not much
        oxygen is around. But this system also causes them to be extremely
        sensitive to changes in acidity. If the surrounding water’s pH dips too
        low, octopuses can’t circulate enough oxygen.
      </li>
      <li>
        After mating, it’s game over for octopuses. Mating and parenthood are
        brief affairs for octopuses, who die shortly after. The species
        practices external fertilization. Multiple males either insert their
        spermatophores directly into a tubular funnel that the female uses to
        breathe, or else literally hand her the sperm, which she always accepts
        with one of her right arm (researchers do not know why).
      </li>
    </ul>
